- Stateless applications
	- does not store session data of the client
- Distributed compute
	- can link together multiple computers over the internet
- Non-local storage
	- cloud storage
		- storing data on cloud spanning over multiple locations
		- not on on-premises HDDs
- Redundant network connections 
	- duplicated infrastructure where additional or alternative instances of network devices and connections are installed
	- to **ensure an alternative** path in case of a failure on the primary service
- Extensive and exhaustive monitoring
	- monitoring at multiple levels and for all conditions
	- i.e. app, db, infra
- Immutable deployments
	- launch a full set of new instances running the new version of the application in a separate autoscaling group, along side with the instances running on old code
	- e.g. rolling updates
- Self-healing infrastructure
	- a set of servers that can detect a malfunction within its own operations and then repair a error(s) without outside intervention.
	- this is after deployment
	- e.g. using scripts
- Deploying any anti-patterns are automatically detected and reported
	- very similar to above
	- this is during deployment
- **Scalability and elasticity**
	- scalable systems don't necessary mean they will scale up/down
	- it's only about being able to reach the peak loads
	- elastic workloads will recognize demands and adapt them
	- it is both increasing and reducing the capacity
