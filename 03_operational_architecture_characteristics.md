### Operational architecture characteristics
- Elasticity
	- ease of adding and removing resources to scale up
- Reliability
	- handling faults and not failing completely
	- How fail-safe is it?
	- Assess if it is a mission critical
- Availability
	- how long the system will need to be available
	- e.g. 24x7, P99 values
- Recoverability
	- How fast are we able 
		- to come back online and 
		- to what extent
- Robustness
	- Ability to handle errors and boundary conditions, edge cases
- Continuity
	- Disaster recovery capabilities and business continuity at the bare minimum
- Performance
	- stress testing, peak analysis, capacity, frequency of functions used
