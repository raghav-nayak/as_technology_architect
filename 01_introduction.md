### Decision criteria
- Domain
- Data architecture
- Organization factors
- Domain/architecture isomorphism
- Monolith vs. Distributed
- Data flow
- communication style - synchronous vs asynchronous

### Different architectures
- Monolith
- Microservices
- Microkernel
- Modular monolith
- Macroservices
- Layered
- Event Driven
- Space based architecture
- Client server architecture
- Master slave
- Pipe filter
- Broker architecture
- Peer to peer
- MVC
- Blackboard
- Interpreter

### Different Types of architectures
- **Software architecture**
	-  Concerned with project architecture, design patterns(architecture) etc.
- **Cloud architecture**
	- Concerned with cloud architecture
	- how modules and independent components work together
	- which cloud technologies to use
- **Database architecture**
	- Concerned with the inner workings of the database
	- ER diagrams etc.
- **Technology architecture**
	- Concerned with the entire lifecycle
	- more or less a very senior developer that also manages other engineers
- **Solutions architecture**
	- Concerned with converting business reqs into viable technical solutions and plan
	- Thinking about the technologies to be used
	- Always be informed and updated with the latest tech in the market
	- Finding the fasted and best at each stage
- **Enterprise architecture**
	- Concerned with understanding how the solution will work in conjunction with the rest of the enterprise architecture
	- understanding data flow, storage and communication
