## Service oriented architecture(SOA)

- one level above micro kernel architecture
- all of the components are at the same level
- database is still monolith;
	- replication and sharding will be there
- complete clarity and separation of concern
- usually 10 services
- each component communication using ESB(enterprise service bus)
