### Decision criteria for choosing a particular architecture
- Domain
	- need good understanding of the domain under design
- Data architecture
	- collaborate with DBA for the data architecture
- **Org factors**
	- external factors 
	- e.g. vendor(AWS, GCP, Twillio etc), pricing.
- Domain/architecture isomorphism
	- microkernel for solutions that require customizability
	- space based architecture for discreet operations
		- e.g. genome analysis
	- microservices for highly scalable apps
- Monolith vs. Distributed
- Data flow
	- understanding data storage and flow throughout the system
- Communication style
	- synchronous vs. asynchronous
	- synchronous 
		- is convenient but can lead to scalability and reliability issues
	- asynchronous
		- has performance but challenges include
			- data sync
			- deadlocks
			- race conditions
- Miscellaneous
	- internal processes
	- team
	- operation concerns
